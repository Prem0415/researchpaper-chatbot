# researchpaper-chatbot

Our chatbot is a powerful tool for anyone looking to explore research papers related to a particular topic. With just a few simple steps, users can access a wealth of knowledge and insights from the Kaggle dataset. To get started, users must first enter a search query that includes a relevant keyword or phrase, followed by the word "recommend". This helps our chatbot to understand the user's intent and narrow down the search results to the most relevant papers.

Once the search query is submitted, our chatbot uses advanced algorithms to scan the Kaggle dataset for papers that match the user's criteria. The results are then displayed on the screen, along with the title of each paper and the name of its author.

It's important to note that our chatbot is only able to suggest research papers that are available in the Kaggle dataset. However, this dataset is extensive and covers a wide range of topics, so there's a good chance that users will find papers relevant to their interests. Additionally, by including the word "recommend" in their search query, users can be confident that the papers suggested by our chatbot are likely to be the most useful and informative for their needs.
